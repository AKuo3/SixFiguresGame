# SixFiguresGame

It's an iteration of everyone's favourite game, "Would Anyone Like To Earn Six Figures?"!
Definitely not "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?".

Written by Andrew Kuo for CIS444 @ CSUSM. Thanks, Mr. Jardin!

Outstanding issues: 

Question randomization doesn't work. Duplicate questions can be chosen.

"Checkpoint dollar values" do not function, so you will always earn $0 or undefined on a loss.

It looks ugly. Needs to be prettied up.
